Design as a science is an interdisciplinary field that bridges creativity, functionality, psychology, and empirical research to create solutions that solve practical problems. Unlike art, which primarily expresses the creator’s vision and emotions, design as a science seeks to meet specific goals, focusing on efficiency, usability, and impact. The scientific approach to design requires systematic observation, hypothesis testing, and often iterative prototyping to understand and improve the way objects, systems, and experiences function. Here’s an overview of what defines design as a science:



1. Empirical Methods and Experimentation

Design as a science relies on observation, measurement, and feedback loops to optimize outcomes. Designers employ empirical methods to test hypotheses about how users will interact with a product or interface. Prototypes, usability testing, and A/B testing are examples where designers use scientific methods to refine and validate ideas.

For instance, in user experience (UX) design, testing is conducted to understand user needs, track interactions, and measure satisfaction. Insights from these tests lead to iterative improvements, a process aligned with scientific experimentation.

2. Human-Centered Approach
