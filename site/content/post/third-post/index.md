Design as a religion is a compelling concept, blending the reverence for aesthetics and functionality with a belief system around the purpose and impact of creating. In this framework, design becomes more than an act; it becomes a practice with principles, rituals, and an ethos shaping the way people think, work, and live. Here’s a detailed look at how this “religion” might be structured:



Core Beliefs

* Form and Function as Sacred Dualities: Like yin and yang, form and function are inseparable in the design religion. Good design is seen as a balance between beauty and practicality, with each project striving to achieve a harmony that serves both utility and aesthetics.
* Human-Centric Purpose: A fundamental belief is that all design exists to improve lives. This “human-centric” doctrine ensures that each creation considers the end user’s experience and welfare, emphasizing empathy and inclusivity.
* Continuous Evolution: Just as religions emphasize growth and enlightenment, design as a religion would stress continuous learning, iteration, and adaptation. There would be an openness to new ideas, methods, and technologies, championing an ever-evolving practice.
* Minimalism and Sustainability as Moral Duties: Less is more, and what’s created should do minimal harm. Followers of design as a religion would be committed to sustainability, seeing waste as a sin and valuing designs that have a gentle footprint on the Earth.
